# Web-form-C-
In this drill I Created a Web Form using Visual Studio 2015

I created a Web Form that allows a user to input their first and last names. 
After entering the data into these two text fields on the Web page, the user clicks a login button and the user's Last name, 
First name appear in a label below the login button.
